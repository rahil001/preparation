        1. Node looks for pending timers like  are ready to be called (timeout, interval, immediate)
        </div>
        <div>
        2. Node looks for pending OS operations and calls revelant callbacks (filesystem operations or some crypto libs).
        </div>
        <div>
        3. Node looks for pending OS Tasks and calls revelant callbacks.

        Event Loop is a single threaded. But behind the scene c++ part of Node is comprises of libUV which has 4 threads(thread pool) by default
        <div>So Node js offloads the computationally expensive task to libuv (thread pool multithreaded)</div>
